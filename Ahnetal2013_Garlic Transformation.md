# Protocol

## Clove Steralization (time: 4 weeks)
1. Break up bulb into individual cloves 
2. Disinfected clove with bleach solution
3. Rinse clove three times with sterile distilled water 
4. The remainder instructions are as describe in Ayabe et al. 1998 
5. Cut garlic cloves into small cubes that contained the basal part of the stem. 
6. Sterilize for 5 min in 70% EtOH
7. Remove residual storage and foliage leaves
8. Extract the basal plate ~1mm thick and cut into 4 pieces
9. Place on LS medium petri dishes
10. Incubate at 25C under 16h photoperiod with fluorescent illumination at 3000 lux

## Callus Induction  (Lenght time: 2 months)
1. Induce callus from root segments of in vitro plantlets on Callis Induction MS medium for 2 months 

## Agrobacterium Co-cultivation (Lenght time: 4 days)
1. Shake Agrobacterium cells LB liquid medium supplemented with 10mg/L hygromycine at 120rpm for 2 days at 28C 
2. Spin bacteria down
3. Suspend cells in co-cultivation medium (OD600 = 1.0) with 100 uM acetosyringone (3',5'-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxyacetophenone)
4. Mix 10ml aliquot of bacterial suspension with chopped calli and incubated for 10 min
5. Transfer calli to co-cultivation medium with removal of the Agrobacterium cells [Unsure what this means?]
6. Culture cali in the dark for 4 days at 25C

## Selection of Transgenic Calli (Lenght time: 12 weeks)
1. Wash tissue with antibiotic water 
2. Place tissue on selection MS medium 
3. Grow in darkness at 25 C for for weeks
4. Subcultures and grow for another 4-week interval 
5. Subculture one more time (12 weeks total)
6. Excise sGFP-expression pieces and transfer to fresh media (See Figure 2)

## Plant Regeneration (Lenght time: 2-6 weeks)
1. Transfer actively growing growing cali to Regeneration MS medium and incubate at 25C under continuous light (40 umol/m^2/s)
2. Plants will regenerate in 2-6 weeks
3. Transfer regenerated plantlets to hormone free MS medium 
4. Transfer to soil
